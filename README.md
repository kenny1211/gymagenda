A central location to for users to create, view, and log workout programs. My personal fitness journey came with much trial and error; to attest to that I have too many Google Bookmarks for PDFs of different excercise regiments. Rather than having to repeatedly flip pages of instructions/personal fitness mantras to locate a workout I want to do, I decided to just make an app that contains the templates for those programs. In addition, this app grants me the ability to create a more personalized routine and also view what works for others who post.

To Do:
- [ ] Toast notifications for succesful post creation and deletion
- [ ] Page reload or redirect after workout program submission
- [ ] Put route to allow excercise edits
- [ ] Calendar page that correlates with chosen workouts
- [ ] Record progress for specific excercises with visual representation
- [ ] General styling / mobile responsiveness
