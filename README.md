An application that serves as a central location for different excercise programs. Currently, users can create, view, and delete programs.

Soon: allow users to choose a specific workout from the database of programs. Upon selection, the app will allow users to record their achieved weight for each excercise in the given workout. Then users will be able to view their progress via charts and completed workouts via calendar.

To Do:

- [ ] Toast notifications for succesful post creation and deletion
- [ ] Page reload or redirect after workout program submission
- [ ] Put route to allow excercise edits
- [ ] Calendar page that correlates with chosen workouts
- [ ] Record progress for specific excercises with visual representation
- [ ] General styling / mobile responsiveness
